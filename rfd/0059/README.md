# RFD 57: Update external services to Node.js v4-TLS

Triton uses node 0.10 heavily for its services, with node 0.8 and 0.12 being
used in a few places. 0.8 is already EOL, with 0.10 EOL on October 1, and 0.12
EOL on December 31. Node.js v4 is currently specified for Long-Term Support
(LST), and will remain supported until April 2018.

It is not critical for internal services to be updated to LTS, although it is
desirable, but external services (e.g. Cloudapi and sdc-docker) should be
updated in order to keep abreast of security fixes.


## Proposal

1) Split sdc-clients apart into separate libraries.
2) Update each of the above libraries independently.

Then for each service:

3) Update the libraries it uses, including any of the above separate libraries.
3) Update the Node.js runtime.


### Library dependencies

Unfortunately, switching from 0.10 to v4 is not as simple as switching Node.js
runtimes, because of libraries we depend upon. Specifically: libuuid and
dtrace-provider both have C bindings. Older versions of libuuid and
dtrace-provider either don't work on 0.10, or don't work on v4. Only
libuuid 0.2.1 and higher, and dtrace-provider and higher, support both
0.10 and v4.

Complicating the situation is that many submodules and sub-submodules use older
libuuid and dtrace-provider modules. bunyan, restify, and ldapjs are examples.

Support across both 0.10 and v4 is highly desirable, because it allows us to
update libraries, and exercise them thoroughly, before updating the runtime as
well.

This is an incomplete list of modules that need updates:

* libuuid older than 0.2.1 (tested and confirmed to work)
* dtrace-provider older than 0.6.0 (tested and confirmed to work)
* bunyan older than 1.5.0 (1.8.2 tested and confirmed to work)
* ldapjs older than 1.0.0 (1.0.0 tested and appears to work)
* restify older than 4.0.1 (but see below)

restify 4.1.1 was tested and confirmed to mostly work, but breaks some proxy
functionality that is kept in a restify fork; updating to the restify mainline
breaks this functionality. As Trent puts it:

---

I think best path forward is for me or someone to do the http\_proxy
fwd-porting to restify-clients#4.x and test it (and to restify-clients#5.x â€“
which is the current development tip, restify-clients#master is currently out of
date). The full set of things I want to do:

* get a restify 2.8.x branch and get our forked changes into it and a published
  2.8.(next) of restify to npm
* get the http\_proxy updates into restify-clients#4.x and #5.x
* do the no\_proxy work (another ticket on me: TOOLS-1398)

### Splitting sdc-clients

sdc-clients contains the clients for most of Triton's internal services. While
having them all in one place is convenient, having all clients in a single
module ties them all to the same dependency versions.

Updating and testing services would easier if there was less risk of breaking
other clients by updating various submodules.

Since we want to split sdc-clients anyway, here is yet another reason to do so.
