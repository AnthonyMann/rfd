An example for showing off Manta projects/orgs behaviour.
Warning: I don't have a solid feel for how to design this for Manta yet.

# with an org

    account 'man'
    account 'samiam'
    account 'fox'
    account 'goat'
    org 'seuss':
        owner 'man'
        group 'eggers': man, samiam, fox, goat
        --
        project 'eggs':
            acl:
                eggers CAN manta:* *
            inst 'eggs0'

This tells you that members of the 'eggers' group can access parts of
'/seuss/...' tagged for the 'eggs' project.

This design could work similarly to role-tags on Manta objects/dirs currently:
creating a resource sets the active-roles as role-tags, use mchmod to update
role-tags.

If you are 'samiam' here, GetObject works fine: if it is in the 'eggs' project,
then it works, else it fails. PutObject is harder:

    echo "would not, could not on a boat" | mput /seuss/stor/eggs/answer12.txt

With what project(s) should the new object be tagged. With roles we have
default-role(s) for a subuser. Q: Do we need/want a "default project" for each
member of an org? Otherwise, we'd require a way to specify the project:

    export MANTA_PROJECT=eggs
    # or:
    ... | mput -P eggs ...


Or what if we had this: **If there is no given active project, then we use
the project(s) of the parent dir.** E.g. if '/seuss/stor/eggs/' has
`projects=eggs`, then we inherit that.

Or should it always inherit the parent dir's project? I.e. (a) no 'mput -P'
option and (b) only an org owner can explicitly set these project tags.

'~~/jobs' is different, we want the project to be an 'active' or 'default'
one for the caller of CreateJob. Hrm.


If you are 'man' here (i.e. an owner of the org), is it more confusing? How
does 'man' operate with reduced (non-owner) privs? Perhaps 'org owner' does
not confer 'manta:*' access. I.e. you'd need to enable yourself with something
like:

    org 'seuss':
        owner 'man'
        acl:
            man CAN manta:* *

But then still have the 'sudo' problem: how to NOT be sudo. XXX



Q: what about '/seuss/jobs'?
Q: what about '/seuss/reports'?
Q: what about '/seuss/public'?


# sharing a particular manta file with an account/group

TODO: show what rule syntax would be here:
    bob CAN manta:Get* ~~/stor/img/awesome.gif

# with an account

TODO: any issues/edge cases? or is this the same 'sudo' problem?
