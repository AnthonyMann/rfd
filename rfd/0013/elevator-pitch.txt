Pitch:

1. You can *optionally* have projects under your account that provide an isolated
   view of resources: e.g. `triton insts` would list only those VMs that
   are part of that project.

2. You can create an *org* with owners and members. Orgs have projects under them
   to hold resources. A project under an org can be marked to have all org
   members as members, or to specifically list which org members can see
   that project... and *with a role*. The role defines what actions that member
   can do on that project's resources.
