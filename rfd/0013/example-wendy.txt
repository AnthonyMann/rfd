# wendy

Wendy has this basic account and current resources:

    account 'wendy':
        email 'wendy@example.com'
        --
        inst 'wvm0'
        inst 'wvm1'
        image 'wimg0'

She adds the 'terraplay' project:

    $ triton project create terraplay
    Created project 'terraplay'

    $ triton profile get -j \
        | json -e 'this.name = this.project = "terraplay"' \
        | triton profile create -f -
    Created profile "terraplay"
    $ triton profile set-current terraplay
    Set "terraplay" as current profile

Then plays with the Joyent blog post using terraform, resulting in:

    account 'wendy':
        inst 'wvm0'
        inst 'wvm1'
        image 'wimg0'
        --
        project 'terraplay':
            inst 'nginx-terraform-01'
            inst 'test-machine'

# account ACL

Wendy has a friend Warren:

    account 'warren'

to whom she wants to give access to her 'wvm1' instance:

    $ triton acl create 'account:warren CAN compute:* instance:wvm1'

(Note: Would like that command to be easier. Learning that much aperture
is harsh. Thinking out loud: `triton acl create 'warren CAN read wvm1'`.)

    account 'warren'
    account 'wendy':
        acl:
            account:warren CAN compute:* instance:wvm1
        --
        inst 'wvm1'
        ...

Now warren can:

    warren$ triton -o wendy inst get wvm1

(Note: Not sure what the syntax should be to specify "wendy's top-level
resources". `triton -P wendy ...` is ambiguous with a possible 'wendy' *project*
of warren's. Maybe using the 'org' field in the profile -- i.e. '-o' -- even
though 'wendy' isn't an org. Or find a common base word for
'account or org'. "Scope"?)


# project acl

Actually, that was wrong. Wendy wants to share her terraplay project with
Warren:

    wendy$ triton acl ls
    SHORTID   RULE
    abcd1234  account:warren CAN compute:* instance:wvm1
    wendy$ triton acl rm abcd1234
    wendy$ triton project acl create terraplay 'account:warren CAN * *'

(Note: Some shortcuts for common canned action lists would be useful.
    $ triton project acl create terraplay -a warren --full
    $ triton project grant-access terraplay -a warren --full
^ Thinking out loud.)

giving us:

    account 'warren'
    account 'wendy':
        inst 'wvm0'
        inst 'wvm1'
        image 'wimg0'
        --
        project 'terraplay':
            acl:
                account:warren CAN * *
            inst 'nginx-terraform-01'
            inst 'test-machine'

And warren should be able to:

    warren$ triton -o wendy -P terraplay insts


# manta area for project

... (TODO)


# groups

Wendy has another friend she wants to give access to this project as well.
Time to use a group:

    wendy$ triton group create friends warren startrek42
    wendy$ triton project acl rm terraplay --all
    wendy$ triton project acl create terraplay 'group:friends CAN * *'

Giving:

    account 'warren'
    account 'startrek42'
    account 'wendy':
        group 'friends': warren, startrek42
        --
        inst 'wvm0'
        inst 'wvm1'
        image 'wimg0'
        --
        project 'terraplay':
            acl:
                group:friends CAN * *
            inst 'nginx-terraform-01'
            inst 'test-machine'

(Q: Should groups be creatable on a project? E.g. that could allow warren
to create groups there. Punt for now.)

# more groups/projects

(I.e. to possibly show if the proposal so far breaks down with lots of
resources.)

Wendy's started doing lots of things with her account, and sharing with
lots of people, effectively running a business:

    account 'wendy':
        group 'foo': warren, ... (5 others)
        group 'bar': startrek42, ... (3 others)
        group 'baz': fred, barney, ... (2 others)
        --
        inst 'wvm0'
        ...
        ---
        project 'terraplay': ...
        project 'foo':
            acl:
                group:foo CAN * *
            ...
        project 'bar':
            acl:
                group:bar CAN * *
            ...
        project 'baz':
            acl:
                group:baz CAN * *
            ...

# migrate to an org

Wendy's business has a name other than 'wendy'. She'd like all this data,
except 'terraplay' and the top-level stuff, to be an org. (Why? What reason to
move to an org? Opportunity to rename the top-level thing? To move *some* of the
resources perhaps.)

... (TODO)



# TODO

XXX manta sharing and lock down
XXX basic org example: why org better than vanilla account?
XXX explore login/ssh/key/auth/audit issues with accounts. E.g. 'wendy' accessing
    things in a project: she isn't in the groups. Need she be?
XXX adding subusers? separate example
XXX could explore the consulting group example (later)
