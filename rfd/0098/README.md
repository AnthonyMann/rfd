# RFD 98 Issue Prioritisation Guidelines

## Overview

Much of the work on the Manta project is tracked in the Joyent JIRA instance,
under the MANTA project.  One of the fields which describes a particular issue
is the Priority.  This document summarises our current expectations for
issues marked with the five priority levels available today.

As always, common sense and discretion are critical when making decisions.  If
these guidelines don't make sense, remember that they are just that:
guidelines.

## Priorities

### 1. Urgent

Defects that will have catastrophic impact on the business; e.g., customer data
loss, protracted total service outages, etc.

### 2. Critical

These issues are materially important to continued or improved service
delivery.  If you have been assigned to a **P2** issue, it probably demands focus
to the exclusion of other work.

### 3. Elevated

Issues at this priority are important, and we need to get to them eventually.
The bulk of non-critical work that needs serious consideration is likely to be
at this priority.

### 4. Normal

This priority is for work that we accept that we might never get around to
doing.

### 5. Low

This priority reflects issues that, though still outstanding, we're not going
to work on.  It is unlikely that a **Low** priority issue that is not
obstructing some higher priority work would see any attention.
